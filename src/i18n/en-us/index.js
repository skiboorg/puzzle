<p><span style="font-size: large;"><span lang="en-US">- Choose one of the levels, click on it and get the elements scattered across the field.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><span lang="en-US">- Move the cursor over any element, grab it and, while holding it, bring it to any other element, if any of the sides of these elements coincide, then they will connect to each other.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><span lang="en-US">- By the method of subsequent selection of elements, with the correct option, they all connect and form a single QR-ART Puzzle.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><span lang="en-US">- Each level has its own time to collect - the more difficult the level, the more time and points are given.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><span lang="en-US">- If you have collected the selected level correctly and on time, an inscription will appear on the playing field &ldquo;YOU WON&rdquo; and you will receive points in RATING, if you could not collect it in time, the inscription &ldquo;YOU LOSE&rdquo; will appear, then you have the opportunity to collect any level again ...</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><span lang="en-US">2. All calculations are carried out in local currency - QR (1 QR = 1 YUAN), the funds transferred by you will be converted into QR-currency, and when funds are withdrawn to your account, they will be converted back.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><span lang="en-US">3. Without registration:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><span lang="en-US">- you can train at all three levels in DEMO, but if you collect correctly, QR-ART Puzzle RATING and BALANCE will not be replenished.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><span lang="en-US">4. At registration, but without replenishment of BALANCE:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><span lang="en-US">- we give 1000 YUAN = 1000 QR to your BALANCE, which you cannot withdraw, but you can transfer all the funds earned on them to your account after you have more than 100 points in RATING.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><span lang="en-US">5. When registering and replenishing BALANCE:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><span lang="en-US">- from 500 to 50,000 YUAN (from 70 to 7000 USD) for each correct collection of QR-ART Puzzle, your RATING will receive from 2 to 6 points, and upon reaching 100 points per month, your BALANCE will increase by 8%.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><span lang="en-US">We give no more than 3 games per day, the number of RATING points per month must be at least 100. Your RATING points are reset to zero every 1st day of a new month.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><span lang="en-US">1 day &gt;&gt; 3 games &gt;&gt; 1 month &gt;&gt; 100 points in RATING = BALANCE + 8%</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><span lang="en-US">6. After receiving 100 points in RATING, you need to fill out a statistical questionnaire, and after that you will be credited with 8% of the amount for BALANCE.</span></span></p>
