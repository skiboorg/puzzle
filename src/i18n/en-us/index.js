<p>1.I want to start play and earn! What do I need to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first and probably the most important thing you will need to start playing is a Game Pass, which is our NFT.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Which NFT should I choose? What is the difference between them?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are 3 types of Game Passes available for purchase: Bronze, Silver and Gold. The color of the pass determines the number of your games per day. If you get 3 and 7 games per day for a Bronze or Silver pass, the Gold pass gives you up to 15 games per day.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3.I bought a nft, what to do next?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To start you need to connect your game pass on our website, then you will get access. The player has several difficulty modes to choose from. The harder the task is, the higher the payment is.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>4.How can I get my earnings?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your earned money is automatically credited to your personal account. Withdrawal is available from 1.5 Sol at any time of day, the commission service for the withdrawal is 9.5%.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>5. What if I passed all available tests?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Available tasks are updated every day at 00:00 UTC, so you can safely solve everything you think you can.</p>
</li>

  aboutText:`

<p>We are a team of computer engineers from the university "Deutsches Forschungszentrum f&uuml;r K&uuml;nstliche Intelligenz" and our main focus is the training and development of AI.</p>

<p>"DFKI is the leading, near-business research institution in Germany in the field of artificial intelligence with branches in Kaiserslautern, Saarbr&uuml;cken and Bremen.</p>

<p>We launched this project with the support of Cyber Valley, whose partners include major companies such as Daimler, Bosch, Amazon, and Facebook. Thanks to this symbiosis, we have access to the most advanced technologies in the field of machine learning, and we can truly claim that our product is the first and unique of its kind</p>

  infoText:`
<p>1.The main disadvantage of all the neural networks and artificial intelligence systems that exist today is that they are not capable of self-learning. <br />It is necessary to process gigabytes of data for a machine to understand how it should act in this or that situation.</p>

<p>2. Using the experience of systems neurophysiology we have created a new model of computer interaction, which recognizes graphical tasks better than deep neural networks do</p>

<p>3. The program is based on a new hybrid technology combining the technologies of hierarchical temporal memory and Recursive Cortical Network. These are special kinds of neural networks, capable of imitating the work of the cerebral cortex, and it is through this symbiosis that new methods of learning and further self-learning became available to us</p>

<p>4. The "mind" of our AI is based on the SingularityNET blockchain. SingularityNet is an open platform for creating a decentralized market for AI services. It is thanks to the SingularityNet blockchain that each participant of our project is a direct "teacher" for our AI, since each module is trained independently of the other, each user actually has his own RoboTutor. The famous humanoid "Sophia" is based on the same blockchain</p>
